## BrickProject Breakout Ball Game

This is a fast paced game where players control a paddle to keep a bouncing ball in play while breaking balls above.
The objective is to clear as many bricks as possible , rack up high scores, and prevent the ball from falling off the screen.
Players have five lives and when all lives are lost , the game ends.
A special fireball mode can be activated by holding the space bar, allowing players to break even the toughest cracked bricks.
